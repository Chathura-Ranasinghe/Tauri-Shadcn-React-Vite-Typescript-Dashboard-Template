## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (or npm)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (required for Tauri)
- [Tauri CLI](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dashboard-template.git
   cd dashboard-template
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server and Tauri in development mode, run:

```bash
yarn tauri dev
```

This will launch the application in a Tauri window with hot-reload enabled for both the backend and the frontend.

### Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:

```bash
yarn tauri build
```

The production-ready binaries will be generated in the `src-tauri/target/release` directory.
